# Light-Keeper
Hello and welcome to the Light Keeper! This is a two player game where one of the two players plays on a microbit. In order to play please connet the microbit to the computer and adapt the 'ser.port' accordingly. The player using the mocrobit is the 'light keeper'. He can use the microbit to place light source on the screen in order to reveal the other player on the screen. He first has to choose which colum to choose, then press the two buttons simultaneously to select it. Afterwards if he selects the row then he will see a light source appear on the screen where he wanted it to be placed. The other player uses awsd to move around. His goal is to get the four keys on the board without getting reveiled by the light! He can be reveiled for few seconds otherwise it is too hard for him. When the game start the player that plays the 'hider' has a small asvantage as everything is dark. However, the walls are still preventing him from directly going to the light, also the light keeper will soon place a light. In order to be able to play, please download the included hex file onto your microbit and use is as your contorler!
